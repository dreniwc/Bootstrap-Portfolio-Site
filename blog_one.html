                <h2 class="text-center">Responsive Web Design</h2>
            

                <p>The industry is continuously changing and adapting to the requirements of the users.  Web developers have to enhance their knowledge, communications, approaches to design and adjust to the user’s requirements. This is leading to new types of job roles within the industry created to enhance the industry’s overall effectiveness.  The Gridset Report indicated that the link between businesses, the client and the web developer have incorporated new job roles relating to management such as Business and Project managers. This allowed the industry to shift in recent years, which led to the introduction of the new roles and the increased visibility of certain existing roles, such as Front-end developers. This has helped to build links between businesses, clients and web developers to become more effective for the communication and management of the projects. </p>

                <p>The report identifies a rise in requirements of responsive design; something now seen as common practice. The adjustment from static web pages to interactive, automatic adjusting responsive sites are increasing the workflow for the designers but give the end user a more memorable and enjoyable experience.</p>  

                <p>The vast amount of device platforms can be seen to keep expand away from what used to be the typical desktop view. All web developers must keep this is mind during the design process in order to fit the client’s user needs to make sure no end-users are unable to access their sites. The developer must consider not only the client they are working with but also the end-user’s requirements. </p>

                <p>As the number and variety of devices continues to grow, optimisation will continue to be a top priority for developers. If a design does not consider optimisation this may jeopardise the user experience and act as a major barrier. The moral responsibility of the designer must always focus on accessibility. This accessibility is linked closely to data/ bandwidth usage, with the new technologies of 4G and Fibre Optic internet connections has allowed for the introduction of new elements to websites, such as embedded Videos that would have otherwise been not supported by slower bandwidth in the past. </p>

                <p>Businesses will always want increase profits, the big impact that a business website can portray on the brand image and reputation give reason for it to be essential that they are viewed in correlation to the brand’s professional business image and accessibility to all users.  </p>

                <p>Accessibility and responsive design are becoming more interlinked; my view is that accessibility should be the prime factor when creating any website for a business. In a recent blog post, ‘What’s the Future of Responsive Web Design?’ By Aaron Gustafson interlinked the points that when we develop an idea using a responsive design approach the physical device factors and bandwidth issues become important considerations as possible user barriers,</p>

                <div class="quote">
                <p>‘Accessibility is about providing good experiences for everyone, regardless of physical or mental abilities, gender, race, or language. It recognizes that we all have special needs—physical limitations, bandwidth limitations, device limitations—that may require us to experience the same interface in different ways.’ Gustafson, A. (2015) </p>
                </div>

                <p>The sharing and work collaboration is allowing the industry to continuously stride further with issue forums and open source code in frameworks allowing the basic structure of HTML, CSS and JS standardized code to be available. This is seen to give most websites similar aspects to each other but it is actually saving web developers time and money to re-invent the wheel to create the common structure of the site. </p>

                <p>The Gridset Responsive Report (2014) has also highlighted to me that the organisation sizes of large agencies have been declining over the past 3 years. This was surprising to me in that the demand for websites remains high and new requirements of responsiveness are requiring more work. </p>

                <p>The report also identified that skills have become more available to small agencies giving them the ability now to create websites to the high professional standards that large agencies alone has previously offered. This may be due to the openly available use of frameworks such as SASS indicated in the report in 2014 as the number 1 tool to enable designers to realise their ideas as SASS allows for a faster development process.  </p>

                <p>I see responsive design not only to be about the viewing capabilities on various viewport sizes but also as a collaboration of responding to different bandwidth/ connection speeds and accessibility. The responsive design has to allow the website to respond to the user’s requirements. Should an obstacle arise, it is the designer’s responsibility to ensure there are no restrictions in the way of the user accessing and interacting with the website in an efficient way.</p>
