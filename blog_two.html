        <div class="row">
            
                <h2 class="text-center">How my Site got it's original look</h2>
            
                <p>To create this site, I enhanced my HTML and CSS skills, researching examples of other portfolios gaining inspiration along with researching HTML & CSS code. Initially, this task was challenging due to the large amount of portfolio sites researched. It was a surprise realising that if I wish to challenge and compete within this industry I had more learning to undertake. </p>   

                <h4>Research</h4>

                <p>Initially I gained an understanding on what other portfolio sites I would be competing against look like. For this I sourced the top 5 online portfolio sites voted for by the <a href="https://thenetawards.com/vote/portfolio/"> Net Awards </a> and <a href="http://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/web-designs/type/portfolio"> webdesign Inspiration </a> illustrating to me that the majority of sites are following a parallax continuous scrolling format. </p> 

                <p>Knowing that I wanted to use a parallax design layout I researched the skills and code required along with responsive web design and accessibility to ensure my website were accessible to everyone on all devices and not dependent on their potential barriers. Looking into a simple, effective method to create a parallax website I found that using min-height: 100vh; within the CSS allowed me to use 100% of the browser’s width to set the height of the section. An article by  <a href="http://lucastswick.com/building-a-single-page-scroller-2015/"> Lucast Swick </a> showed me how to incorporate this technique. </p>

                <p><a href="http://adamkaplan.me/grid/"> Adam Kaplan’s </a> website gave me a good first read enabling me to understand responsive design and taking the mobile first approach to my design. The article gave a step by step guide on how to use media queries efficiently and effectively and use normalize.css to enable cross-browser support. </p>

                <h4> Design </h4>

                <p>Designing wireframes, mood boards and looking at typography were key to the design process. The illustration below shows that my design idea was to focus on simplicity but also to have an effective professional feel with a background image within the header and the use of columns to organize my content.</p> 

                <p>
                  <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="img/blog_two/lo-fi.jpg" title="Lo-Fi wire frame" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" >
                  <img src="img/blog_two/lo-fi.jpg" alt="First design required a lo quailty mock up of the layout" width="200" height="320" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  </a>
                  <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="img/blog_two/hi-fi_big.jpg" title="High-Fi wire frame" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  <img src="img/blog_two/hi-fi.jpg" alt="A higher quailty mock up of my design including colours and possible images" width="200" height="320" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  </a>
                </p>

                <p>The design I have created combines all the relevant information about me, with a brief introduction, skill sets, portfolio of past work and relevant contact information including both email and social networking sites along with the contact form. I incorporated Adam Kaplan’s design mainly using the 2 and 3 columns layouts to organize my content in a professional yet simple manner.</p>

                <p>After several adjustments, I chose the colour scheme orange (#ff8300) and grey (#aaabab). From the beginning of my site’s development this was an original idea and seen as ‘different’ with the orange standing out from the grey and as the process progressed and designs were incorporated the colours worked well and became part of my site’s friendly and professional feel, linking to my mood board. </p>  

                <p>
                  <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="img/blog_two/mood_board.jpg" title="Mood Board" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  <img src="img/blog_two/mood_board.jpg" alt="combining colours, typography and possible deisns from inspirations into an image for visual assistance in the design process" width="350" height="300" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  </a>
                  <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="img/blog_two/siteplan.jpg" title="Site Plan" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  <img src="img/blog_two/siteplan.jpg" alt="Page strucutres displaying links from specific pages" width="214" height="300" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  </a>
                </p>
                 
                <h4>Build </h4>

                <p>Researching new code and practices, tweaking minor parts of my site throughout the process I adapted the use of jQuery and CSS to enhance the viewing and end-user’s experience on my website. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> was a helpful site offering videos, snippets of code and forums to allow me to enhance my skills. All my code had to follow the industry practice and be correct by validation; this was checked using W3C School Validator Checker. </p>

                <p>Throughout the design process Web developers must always consider their audience and accessibility rights. I consulted Joshua O’Connor’s book, <a href="http://aprompt.ca/docs/Pro-HTML5-Accessibility.pdf"> ‘Pro HTML5 Accessibility’ </a>  learning that using ALT tags in the correct manner was a necessity and incorporating skip links for screen readers to navigate to the content was a must. I incorporated ALT tags into my images so not to restrict anyone’s access to my site. </p>

                <p>During the build process I found a variety of responsive navigations that could be used for my site; each one coded with different styles and techniques to give the user an easy, stress-free experience of my web site on any device platform. </p>

                <p>I started using a navigation by <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/responsive-web-nav/"> HONGKIAT</a> which, after incorporating into my site I found to be to ‘blocky’ with no real clear layout in the page ordering. Below is a screen shot of when I incorporated this. As you can see it did not give the user a full understanding of the page order, nor did it seem to operate efficiently. </p>

                <p>   
                  <a class="image-popup-no-margins" href="img/blog_two/first_nav.jpg" title="First navigation trial" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  <img src="img/blog_two/first_nav.jpg" alt="Navigation incorporated with my site but didnt suite my requirments and suite site design"  width="107" height="200" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
                  </a>
                </p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                <p>The use of jQuery and responsive incorporation with the navigation and column layouts worked well for the professional image I desired. The layout feels intuitive and responsive and helps the user to navigate around the site with ease. This observation could have been addressed through improved adjustments to my content interaction which the user could have benefitted from using enhanced higher CSS and incorporating more Java script code. This would have made the blogs more interactive and the content more engaging. </p>
